# Navigation RSC Parcel 
Try out Navigation React Mobile and RSC's using Parcel.

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the RSC Parcel example:

    npm install --force
    npm run build
    npm run start
	
Then visit http://localhost:3001/ in your browser to see RSC Navigation in action. The initial scene is server-rendered and subsequent navigations only fetch the next scene.
