# Navigation RSC Vite
Try out Navigation React and RSC's using Vite.

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the RSC Vite example:

    npm install --force
    npm run dev
	
Then visit http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to see RSC Navigation in action. The initial content is server-rendered and subsequent navigations only fetch the content that's changed.
