# Navigation Native Fabric
Navigation works on the new React Native architecture (Fabric).

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the Twitter example:

    npm install
    cd ios && bundle exec pod install && cd ..
    npx react-native start
    npx react-native run-android
    npx react-native run-ios
