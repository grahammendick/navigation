# navigation
[Navigation](http://grahammendick.github.io/navigation/) is a JavaScript library that adds a State machine layer on top of a Router. It associates a single source of data with the active State. Building Hyperlinks is as easy as changing the State and/or data.

    var Navigation = require('navigation');
